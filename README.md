## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me
<!-- 
- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working in **[Covid-19 Tracker](FIJITSU/)** -->

- üå±Even though I have completed my bachelors in Mechanical Engineering, it did not spark my interest. However, I was always interested in the field of technology. One day, I got the opportunity to work on some software design . During this time, I developed an interest in coding and web development.

- To learn more about the field of web development, I decided to enroll in a professional course.

- Currently, I am an aspiring full stack web developer, with a specialization in HTML | CSS | JAVASCRIPT | BOOTSTRAP. However, as I have successfully completed numerous Project , I have gained expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
